# CLI-Timer
A simple CLI timer in python that I wrote because not a single OS comes with a timer app except for phones.

To use this you must first change your active directory to the folder with the Presets.json and Timer.py files, they must be in the same folder.

i.e: cd C:\Users\You\Downloads\CLI-Timer

Then simply run the app.

Presets can be put in the Presets.json file with costom commands.

Type help for a list of commands.
